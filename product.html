<h2>Indian FTR 1200</h2>
<img src="img/foto3.jpeg">
<p class="price">$12,999</p>
<p>Indian has scored remarkable successes since the brand’s relaunch in 2013, 
  progress that was built on the back of traditional cruisers with classic riding
   dynamics.</p>
<p> In other words, not the kinds of bikes you’d choose to chase a Ducati into the canyons.
    But for 2019, Indian finally has a sportier offering, and it’s a stunner.</p>

  many of those machines duplicate the style of a full-fledged The affordable 300cc 
  class of bikes has ballooned in recent years. </p>
<p>But many of those machines duplicate the style of a full-fledged 
    sport bike in a smaller size which can mean hunched-over, cramped ergonomics for the daily 
    commuter—especially if the rider is on the tall side.</p>

<h2>Royal Enfield Continental GT</h2>
<img src="img/foto6.jpg">
<p class="price">$5,999</p>
<p>The Royal Enfield brand has 100 years of history behind it, but the name hasn’t 
  held much sway with American bikers in recent years. The reason is twofold: middling
   build quality and an incomplete product lineup.</p>
<p> But lately the motorcycle company based in 
    India has been eager to expand and has doubled down on quality.</p>

<h2>Yamaha YZF-R3</h2>
<img src="img/foto7.jpg">
<p class="price">$4,999</p>
<p>These are glory days for anyone seeking small-displacement sporty bikes with 
  budget-friendly price tags. The Yamaha YZF-R3 has filled that niche since 2015.
   </p>
<p>Now the R3 is redesigned for ’19 with sleek new bodywork that makes it look like its bigger, 
    more powerful siblings. A redesigned fuel tank should help riders nestle in behind a more 
    aerodynamic front fairing. There’s a clean new LCD dash pod, too.</p>

<h2>2019 Triumph Bonneville Speed Twin</h2>
<img src="img/foto8.png">
<p class="price"> $12,100</p>
<p>The original Triumph Speed Twin was introduced in 1938 continued into the 1960s, 
  and cemented Britain (and America’s) love for brisk twin cylinder bikes.</p>
<p> This
    new one lives up to the name with a nearly 100 hp 1200cc motor that’s been plucked 
    from the company’s sporty Thruxton.</p>

<h2>Husqvarna Svartpilen 401</h2>
<img src="img/foto9.png">
<p class="price">: $6,299</p>
<p>The Swedish brand Husqvarna has a long and storied history producing dirt bikes. </p>
<p>But this new Svartpilen (which translated means ‘black arrow’) 
    401 along with the larger, more powerful and more expensive 701, mark a return to road bikes.</p>

<div class="numb10">
<h2>2019 Kawasaki ZX-6R</h2>
<img src="img/foto10.png">
<p class="price">$9,999</p>
<p>It’s not often that a new model shaves almost $2,000 off the base price of the last one. 
  But that’s what Kawasaki has done here. </p>
<p>The new 2019 ZX-6R is exactly $1,700 cheaper than the 2018 model.
    And for any rider considering a middleweight sports bike—that’s an amazing deal.</p>

<h2>Suzuki SV650X</h2>
<img src="img/foto11.jpg">
<p class="price"> $8,399</p>
<p>No bike deserves the popular café racer look more than Suzuki’s beloved SV650. 
  The SV is one of the greatest starter bikes on the market, but these machines are 
  fun to ride for any skill level.</p>
<p> And the new Glacier White paint scheme fits the bill perfectly. At just over eight grand,
   the X is only a bit pricier than the regular SV650 with ABS.</p>

<img src="img/foto12.jpg">
<p class="price">$12,499</p>
